Gabriel Levine, Maria Smith, and Graham Northrup's git repository for the CS122 project

Description
-----------
Little Bird is a tool that finds how Twitter users feel about particular topics. When a user provides a query, Little Bird selects recent tweets containing the query and runs a sentiment analysis program on each tweet to get a rating. An analysis of these tweet ratings are returned to the user.

Installation
-------------
git clone https://github.com/gnorthrup/cs122-GMG

In order for the program to run, the following packages need to be installed with sudo pip3 install or sudo pip install:

bs4
csv
json
matplotlib.pyplot
nltk (if you would like to generate your own bayesian dict, you will need to install the nltk corpus as well)
numpy
pitchfork
PIL
random
re
requests
sqlite3
tweepy
twitter
wordcloud
django

Usage
-----
To launch the Django server, run:

python3 manage.py runserver --nothreading

from the outer_bird directory.

To make a query, type in a string in the box next to "What do you want to know about"

If it is a movie, book, or Artist, Album select this from the dropdown menu to get a more "official" rating plotted with our generated rating

Lastly check Top 10 and/or Bottom 10 in order to see the 10 tweets with the best or worst rating from the selection

Hitting ask sends this information to the backend where the ratings and images are generated.

Originality Tagging
-------------------
"Direct Copy" : Generated by installed package (Django,
etc) few edits made

"Modified" : Generated by installed package and meaningful edits made OR heavily utilized template from
tutorial session (Django session or TA session)

"Original" : Original code or heavily modified given
structure

The Code
--------
The content of the code to run Little Bird is located in the outer_bird/get_rating directory.

-urls.py : the url dispatcher for the app, works in tandem with views.py to deliver html files
-views.py : processes the url request and renders the appropriate html template
-tweets.py : contains the Tweets and Query classes and functions for streaming and seraching the Twitter API
-tweets_db.py : contains functions for setting up, updating, and querying tweet databases. NOTE: this functionality was not used in the final implementation
-sentiment.py : contains several functions for performing sentiment analysis on tweets
-plots.py : contains functions for creating plots and images related to sentiment analysis of tweets
-doesthething.py : contains the main function that incorporates all the components of querying Twitter and sentiment analysis

Other Directories
-----------------
The repository also have several other directories, some necessary for the implementation, others just to store things not in the final implementation

-outer_bird/little_bird (Direct copy, Django generated, the only user written code is in the url dispatcher where we direct it to get_rating, where most of the work is): just a Django wrapper with a url dispatcher that sends all urls to the get_rating app where the rest of the functional code is

-outer_bird/get_rating/templates (All original files): directory that stores all of the html templates, used by the Django render function to produce the html file returned to the user

-outer_bird/get_rating/static : stores the images called and the css file 

-Other_Stuff : This directory stores all of the files not in the final implementation, also original copies of a lot of the code files are stored here before they were copied into outer_bird/get_rating
